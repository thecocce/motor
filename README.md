##2d physics &amp; computational geometry (motor)

motor is an impulse-based rigid-body physics engine based on Box2D (http://www.box2d.org)

## Installation
Install [Haxe](http://haxe.org/download) and run `$ haxelib install polygonal-motor` from the console.
This installs the polygonal-motor library hosted on [lib.haxe.org](http://lib.haxe.org/p/polygonal-motor), which always mirrors the git master branch. From now on just compile with `$ haxe ... -lib polygonal-motor`.
If you want to test the latest beta build, you should pull the dev branch and add the src folder to the classpath via `$ haxe ... -cp src`.
